/**
 * Pi Durable storage for agent sessions.
 *
 * Every Seed session owns one Pi Durable Session, stored in the agents database beside the
 * session's log (`session_durable_files`). Its root conversation is the model-facing transcript of
 * the session: exact provider messages (thinking blocks, reasoning items, usage), the positional
 * system prompt, and the checkpoints of the turn in flight. A process that dies mid-turn leaves
 * that work pending in the store, and the run that retries it reopens the store and continues
 * from the last checkpoint.
 *
 * The store is Pi Durable's own append-only JSONL format, unchanged. Only where its files live is
 * Seed's: {@link sessionFileSystem} keeps each file as rows of one table, an append being one
 * inserted row. So a session's state is in one database, backed up and deleted with it, and Seed
 * maintains no storage engine of its own.
 *
 * The Seed log (`session_events`) stays the canonical record of what happened. The two are kept in
 * step from both sides:
 *
 * - Everything the harness produces is projected into the log, one durable entry at a time, and
 *   the event rows carry the entry id (`session_events.pi_entry_id`), so a projection interrupted
 *   by a crash is finished on the next open and never repeated.
 * - Everything else that reaches the log (user messages, user-run verbs, system notices, results
 *   of delegated work) is imported into the conversation before the next turn. The import mark
 *   lives in the {@link SyncDoc} document, committed together with the imported entries.
 *
 * A result that arrives long after its call (a delegated child finishing) is written as a context
 * edit of the placeholder the call was answered with. When the log holds something that cannot be
 * added to the conversation as it stands (a session that predates this store, a call the runtime
 * had to answer after a restart), the conversation's context is rebuilt from the log behind a
 * fresh head; the earlier entries stay in storage.
 *
 * One harness owns a store at a time. Only the run that holds the session's turn opens it.
